My plan is teddy at the center with a text hey girl. Beneath the bear there is text "Something is speacial today. Right?", There was a rounded arrow button in the bottom moves twice in the x and y axis. After the button was clicked. the page is updated with an another teddy with a txt "Let me think" then the teddy is changed by "Yes it's your birthday", suddenly poppers are dropped from the top of the screen. More teddy bears appear in the screen dancing. There was a paragraph in the center "Happy birthday Nandhana, Maybe we met just a month  ago but I feel like my soul already met you at the beginning of time. Enjoy your day as possible , live long , stay happy , stay consistent so I know you will never fail anytime anywhere". After a 30 seconds there is a curtain which closes the screen. with a meme girl with a text "What are you still looking at?"
